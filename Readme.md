# Tara Frontend(Mobile)

This project is the frontend part of the Tara App, a QR and barcode scanning based shopping application. This app allows users to scan QR codes, scan product barcodes, and manage their virtual carts. Please refer to the [Tara Backend](https://github.com/Onurhnf/tara-backend-nodejs-expressjs) repository for the back-end implementation.

## Features

- Users can register and log in to the application.
- Users can scan QR codes at store entrances to access the virtual cart.
- Users can scan product barcodes to view detailed product information.
- Users can add desired items to the cart and manage their carts.
- Users can securely complete payment transactions within the app. (not implemented)
- Users can track their orders and view past order history.

## Payment Functionality

Please note that the current version of the back-end repository does not include the implementation of payment functionality. If you wish to integrate payment features into your application, you will need to implement the necessary code and configuration to connect with a payment gateway of your choice.
